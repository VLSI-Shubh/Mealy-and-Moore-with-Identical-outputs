# 🔁 FSM Sequence Detector – Mealy vs Moore (Detecting "1011")

This project implements a **sequence detector for the binary pattern `1011`**, using both **Mealy** and **Moore** finite state machines. The focus is to understand their architectural differences in output behavior, state usage, and timing — all within a Verilog implementation.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The FSMs are designed to read a serial bitstream and assert the output high (`1`) for one clock cycle when the exact sequence `1011` is detected. The same logic is implemented using:

- **Mealy machine** – Output depends on current state **and** input
- **Moore machine** – Output depends only on current state

Both FSMs are written in Verilog, simulated, and visualized with waveforms to compare their behavior and structural differences.

## ⚙️ Design Differences

| Aspect | Mealy FSM | Moore FSM |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Output Control | Depends on state and input | Depends only on state |
| Number of States | 4 | 5 |
| Output Timing | Immediate (same clock cycle) | One clock cycle delayed |
| Design Simplicity | Slightly more compact | Slightly more predictable |

## 📊 Waveform Analysis

### 🔵 Mealy FSM

In the Mealy machine, the output `out = 1` is asserted during the **same cycle** when the final bit of the sequence (`1`) is received. This makes it slightly faster in terms of response, but it is also more sensitive to input transitions and prone to glitches if not timed carefully.

### 🟢 Moore FSM

In the Moore version, the output becomes `1` **after** the entire sequence has been received and the FSM transitions into a dedicated "output" state. This results in a **one-cycle delay**, but provides more reliable and stable output — especially useful in real hardware systems where output stability matters.

This diagram shows the state transitions for detecting `1011`. The Mealy FSM uses 4 states, while the Moore FSM extends it to 5 states to isolate the output behavior.

## ✅ Conclusion

Through this project, I have explored the **practical trade-offs between Mealy and Moore FSMs** by implementing both styles for the same sequence detection logic.  

While the Mealy machine offers a more **compact design with faster output**, it comes with the risk of **glitchy behavior** due to input dependence in the output logic. The Moore machine, though it uses an extra state and introduces a **cycle delay**, produces more **stable and predictable outputs**, making it more suitable for hardware systems where timing and reliability are critical.

This exercise helped deepen my understanding of **state-based design**, **output timing control**, and how **FSM structure affects circuit behavior** — which is essential in digital design and VLSI systems.
