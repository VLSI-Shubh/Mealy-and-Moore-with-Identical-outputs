# 🔁 FSM Sequence Detector – Mealy vs Moore (Detecting "1011")

This project implements a **sequence detector for the binary pattern `1011`**, using both **Mealy** and **Moore** finite state machines. The focus is to understand their architectural differences in output behavior, state usage, and timing — all within a Verilog implementation.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The FSMs are designed to read a serial bitstream and assert the output high (`1`) for one clock cycle when the exact sequence `1011` is detected. The same logic is implemented using:

- **Mealy machine** – Output depends on current state **and** input
- **Moore machine** – Output depends only on current state

Both FSMs are written in Verilog, simulated, and visualized with waveforms to compare their behavior and structural differences.

## ⚙️ Design Differences

| Aspect | Mealy FSM | Moore FSM |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Output Control | Depends on state and input | Depends only on state |
| Number of States | 4 | 5 |
| Output Timing | Immediate (same clock cycle) | One clock cycle delayed |
| Design Simplicity | Slightly more compact | Slightly more predictable |

## 📊 Waveform Analysis

### 🔵 Mealy FSM and Moore FSM

In the Mealy machine, the output `out = 1` is asserted during the **same cycle** when the final bit of the sequence (`1`) is received. This makes it slightly faster in terms of response, but it is also more sensitive to input transitions and prone to glitches if not timed carefully.Whereas in the Moore version, the output becomes `1` **after** the entire sequence has been received and the FSM transitions into a dedicated "output" state. This results in a **one-cycle delay**, but provides more reliable and stable output — especially useful in real hardware systems where output stability matters.

- **States used**: 4  
- **Output depends on**: Current state **and** input  
- **Advantage**: Fewer states required  
- **Drawback**: Output may glitch due to input changes

- **States used**: 5  
- **Output depends only on**: Current state  
- **Advantage**: More stable outputs  
- **Drawback**: Usually more states required

These diagrams clearly illustrate how both FSM models handle the same pattern detection logic using different architectural approaches.

## ✅ Conclusion

Through this project, I have explored the **practical trade-offs between Mealy and Moore FSMs** by implementing both styles for the same sequence detection logic.  

While the Mealy machine offers a more **compact design with faster output**, it comes with the risk of **glitchy behavior** due to input dependence in the output logic. The Moore machine, though it uses an extra state and introduces a **cycle delay**, produces more **stable and predictable outputs**, making it more suitable for hardware systems where timing and reliability are critical.

This exercise helped deepen my understanding of **state-based design**, **output timing control**, and how **FSM structure affects circuit behavior** — which is essential in digital design and VLSI systems.
